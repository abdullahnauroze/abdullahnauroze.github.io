I received my BSc. in Computer Engineering (Sum Cum Laude) from University of Engineering & Technology, Taxila (Pakistan) in 2005, MSc. in Electrical Engineering (Wireless Systems) from Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) Stockholm, Sweden in 2008, MSc. and Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Electromagnetics & MEMS) from Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA in 2018 and 2019 respectively. During my Ph.D., I was a member of ATHENA lab working under the supervision of [Prof. Manos Tentzeris](http://tentzeris.ece.gatech.edu/index.html) on smart shape-reconfigurable 4D RF structures using inkjet/3D printing technologies. Apart from my engineering  hold a Management of Technology certificate from Scheller School of Business (Georgia Institute of Technology) with focus on entrepreneurship & small business development.

 During Fall 2017, I worked with 5G phased array antenna design team at Qualcomm (San Diego) to design, test and fabricate phased array antennas for 5G enabled handheld devices. In 2018, I shared National Science Foundation fellowship under [Innovation Corps (I-Corps)](https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/i-corps/) program which led to realization of an Atlanta based tech startup -- [Atheraxon](https://www.atheraxon.com/). The focus of the company is to provide long-range (up-to 1 km) wireless RFID-based sensors for smart agriculture, asset tracking and environmental monitoring. I was involved with realization of smart noise immune antennas at Amazon Lab126 (Sunnyvale, CA) to improve desence in Alexa enabled devices while reducing their cost, fabrication complexity and size. 

I also held various academic positions (for more than 7 years) at some of the most prestigious universities in Pakistan. He has authored/co-authored more than 30 scientific papers in some of the most prestigious peer-reviewed journals and conferences in the world including _Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)_, _IEEE Proceedings_ & _IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory & Techniques_ to name a few. The work has also been highlighted in some of the renowned international media outlets. He is an active member of [National Incubation Center Lahore (Pakistan)](https://niclahore.lums.edu.pk/ "NIC")-- a first of its kind incubation and acceleration platform that aims to promote entrepreneurship amongst college graduates and young entrepreneurs in Pakistan for medium to small business development through public and private partnership.

My primary research interests lie at the intersection of art, deployable structures, material science and applied electromagnetics. The central theme of his research is investigation of novel techniques to realize smart tunable multilayer “_4D_” RF structures using additive manufacturing technologies such as inkjet-printing and 3D-printing, that can tune their frequency response on-demand by simply changing their shape. One of the most promising techniques for realization of such components draws inspiration from ancient Japanese art of paper folding called _origami_, which gives a systematic methodology to transform a 2D surface into a complex 3D/4D structure. This presents a paradigm shift in realization of fully printed complex, tunable & structurally robust 4D RF structures that would otherwise be impossible to realize using conventional fabrication technologies such as photolithography and milling.
