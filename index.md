I received my BSc. in Computer Engineering (Sum Cum Laude) from University of Engineering & Technology, Taxila (Pakistan) in 2005, MSc. in Electrical Engineering (Wireless Systems) from Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) Stockholm, Sweden in 2008, MSc. and Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (Electromagnetics & MEMS) from Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA in 2018 and 2019 respectively. During my Ph.D., I was a member of ATHENA lab working under the supervision of [Prof. Manos Tentzeris](http://tentzeris.ece.gatech.edu/index.html) on smart shape-reconfigurable 4D RF structures using inkjet/3D printing technologies. Apart from my engineering  hold a Management of Technology certificate from Scheller School of Business (Georgia Institute of Technology) with focus on entrepreneurship & small business development.

<br /> 

My primary research interests lie at the intersection of art, deployable structures, material science and applied electromagnetics. The central theme of his research is investigation of novel techniques to realize smart tunable multilayer “_4D_” RF structures using additive manufacturing technologies such as inkjet-printing and 3D-printing, that can tune their frequency response on-demand by simply changing their shape. One of the most promising techniques for realization of such components draws inspiration from ancient Japanese art of paper folding called _origami_, which gives a systematic methodology to transform a 2D surface into a complex 3D/4D structure. This presents a paradigm shift in realization of fully printed complex, tunable & structurally robust 4D RF structures that would otherwise be impossible to realize using conventional fabrication technologies such as photolithography and milling.
