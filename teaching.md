## 2017-19

#### ECE4350-Electromagnetic & Microwave Applications <br><sup>Fall 2019,18,17, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta (USA)</sup>
I delivered guest lectures for the course three years in a row. The lectures mostly covered use of origami principles for realization of next-generation of RF and microwave structures.

## 2014

#### EE-483 FYP: Intelligent home safety and anti-theft device<br><sup>Spring 2014, National University of Computer & Emerging Science, Islamabad (Pakistan)
</sup>
I supervised two undergraduate students (M. Qamar Islam & Humayun Sajid) for their final year project. The aim of the project was to realize a smart home security device that used GSM services to alert the authorities and neighbors in case of a break-in via mass text service. The device was especially designed to meet the demands of the Pakistani cities which did not have mobile internet services. Mr. Islam is currently working with IBM (Pakistan) as a data scientist.

#### EE-223 Signals & Systems<br><sup> Summer & Spring 2014, National University of Computer & Emerging Science, Islamabad (Pakistan)</sup>
I taught the undergraduate course to BSc. Electrical Engineering class of 50 students. The aim of the course was to develop a detailed understanding of LTI systems through mathematical analysis. It enabled the students to have a deep insight about the information contents of a signal and the different ways to process it, understand the critical issues in linear systems and get a vision to improve them. At the end of the course, the students were be able to implement various systems in Matlab and process information according to the requirements with due consideration to stability issues.


## 2013

#### EE-305 Electromagnetic theory<br><sup>Fall 2013, National University of Computer & Emerging Science, Islamabad (Pakistan)</sup>
I taught the undergraduate course to BSc. Electrical Engineering class of 140 students.

#### EE-308 Microwave Engineering<br><sup>Spring & Summer 2013, National University of Computer & Emerging Science, Islamabad (Pakistan)</sup>
I taught the undergraduate course to BSc. Telecommunication Engineering class of 60 and 30 students in spring and summer semesters respectively.

#### EE-483 FYP: Reduced size printed 2.4GHz helical antenna<br><sup>Spring 2013, National University of Computer & Emerging Science, Islamabad (Pakistan)</sup>
I supervised two undergraduate students (Muddassar Nauman & Sohaib Anwar) for their final year project. The aim of the project was to investigate and fabricate a reduced-size printed helical antenna for WiFi band on regular PCB. Mr. Nauman is recipient of highly competitive Chief Minister Merit Scholarship (Pakistan) and working in NEMS Lab at Australian National University as a Ph.D. student. Mr. Anwar is currently working at Nokia (Pakistan).

#### EE-105 Digital Logic Circuits Lab<br><sup>Spring 2013, National University of Computer & Emerging Science, Islamabad (Pakistan)</sup>


## 2012

#### EE-305 Electromagnetic theory<br><sup>Fall and Spring 2012, National University of Computer & Emerging Science, Islamabad (Pakistan)</sup>
I taught the undergraduate course to BSc. Electrical Engineering class of 140 and 50 students in fall and spring semesters respectively.

#### EE-407 Wave Propagation and Antenna Theory<br><sup>Spring 2012, National University of Computer & Emerging Science, Islamabad (Pakistan)</sup>
I taught the undergraduate course to BSc. Telecommunication Engineering class of 50 students.
