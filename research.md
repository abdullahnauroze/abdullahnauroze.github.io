# Research 
My research interests include deployable/foldable 4D RF structures, microfluidics, smart tunable reflector surfaces, and 3D/inkjet-printed flexible RF structures. I solve problems related to realization of tunable 3D/inkjet-printed flexible antennas, smart agriculture, e-health and smart origami-inspired tunable RF structures.  


## [<u>Origami-inspired 4D inkjet-printed Tunable RF Structures</u>](https://soumyabrata.github.io/cloud/)
The main aim of the research was to realize smart shape-reconfigurable printed EM reflector surfaces (such as frequency selective surfaces) that can tune their electromagnetic response with respect to changes in their environment. These state-of-the-art structures can be used in wide range of terrestrial, outerspace, IoT and biomedical applications such as Large Intelligent Surfaces (LIS) for upcoming 6G networks, stealth, EMC/EMI sheilding, tunable filters, deployable reflectarrays for cubesats to name a few. The work is first-of-its-kind that presents a systematic approach to design and program them to achieve wideband, continuous-range tunability to meet the system requirement. Moreover, it also presents a mathematic model to predict their electromagnetic behavior with every folding configuration allowing the results to be used by non-electrical engineers. The work has won accolades around the globe and has been published in some of the highest impact factor journals including IEEE Proceedings, Proceedings of Naional Academy of Science (USA) and IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory & Techniques.
