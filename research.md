# Research

My research interests include deployable/foldable 4D RF structures, microfluidics, smart tunable reflector surfaces, and 3D/inkjet-printed flexible RF structures. I solve problems related to design and realization of flexible tunable RF structures, origami-inspired RF structures, smart ci  ties, smart sensors, Internet-of-things and e-health.

## [<u>Origami-inspired 4D inkjet-printed Tunable RF Structures</u>](https://www.nauroze.com/research)

The main aim of the research was to realize smart shape-reconfigurable inkjet-printed EM reflector surfaces (such as frequency selective surfaces) that can tune their electromagnetic response with respect to changes in their environment. These state-of-the-art structures can be used in wide range of terrestrial, outerspace, IoT and biomedical applications such as _Large Intelligent Surfaces (LIS), stealth, EMC/EMI sheilding, tunable filters, deployable transmit/reflectarrays_ for cubesats to name a few. The first-of-its-kind work presents for-the-first-time a systematic approach to design and program them to achieve wideband, continuous-range tunability to meet the system requirement. Moreover, it also presents a mathematical model to predict the electromagnetic behavior of these structures with every folding configuration allowing the results to be used by non-electrical engineers. The work has won accolades around the globe and has been published in some of the highest impact factor journals including _IEEE Proceedings, Proceedings of Naiyonal Academy of Science (USA)_ and _IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory & Techniques_.[\[read more\]](https://www.nauroze.com/origami/)
